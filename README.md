<p style="font-size: 25px" align="center"><b>Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling - HTTP Add-On</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 25px" align="center">

KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. With this add-on, you can easily autoscale your HTTP workloads.

| ðŸš§ **Experimental - Not for production** ðŸš§|
|---------------------------------------------|
| âš  The HTTP add-on is in [experimental stage](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/538) and not ready for production. <br /><br />It is provided as-is without support.

>In addition to the above, this codebase moves very quickly. We can't currently guarantee that any part of it will work. Neither the complete featureset nor known issues may not be fully documented. Similarly, issues filed against this project may not be responded to. **We will release and announce a beta release of this project**, and after we do that, we will document and respond to issues properly.

## Installation
